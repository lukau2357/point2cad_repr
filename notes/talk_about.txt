- Different runtimes across different numpy versions.
- Showcase full pipeline results for different point clouds
- Discuss that the final result of Point2CAD is not a true CAD - requires true BRep parametric representation
- What about master thesis, it's likely that the actual work will deviate from the proposed one in master thesis application
- A lot of notes regarding mathematical machinery, mesh operations and discrepancies between paper and implementation, 10-ish pages,
  maybe more?

- CADRecode simply did not work for 2 sample point clouds. It has a context length of 256, single ABC clusters contain up to 1000 points.
- Point2Primitive seems to be the closest to a full BRep model out of all papers (along with CADRecode of course), it describes a CAD model
  in terms of sketch/extrude operations and it does not (at least for now) seem to have a limit on the number of input points.
- Another interesting path is using OCCT and Mesh2BRep-style CAD construction in the existing Poin2CAD primitive fitting flow. Big room for 
  novelty, but hight risk!
