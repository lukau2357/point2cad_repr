- Different runtimes across different numpy versions.
- Showcase full pipeline results for different point clouds
- Discuss that the final result of Point2CAD is not a true CAD - requires true BRep parametric representation
- What about master thesis, it's likely that the actual work will deviate from the proposed one in master thesis application
- A lot of notes regarding mathematical machinery, mesh operations and discrepancies between paper and implementation, 10-ish pages,
  maybe more?

---- Post Point2CAD ----
- CADRecode simply did not work for 2 sample point clouds. It has a context length of 256, single ABC clusters contain up to 1000 points.
- Point2Primitive seems to be the closest to a full BRep model out of all papers (along with CADRecode of course), it describes a CAD model
  in terms of sketch/extrude operations and it does not (at least for now) seem to have a limit on the number of input points.
- Current occupation: Use Point2CAD fitted surfaces and construct a real BRep model from them. Convert INR to BSpline, perform intersections
  using OpenCascade Python bindings, clip the objects to the input point cloud. If successful, a real contribution, no one has done this
  so far up to my knowledge.
- Another interesting direction: Instead of 2 steps: fit INR + fit a BSpline, somehow jointly train INR to adapt a BSpline, this
  would be another research novelty.
