- Different runtimes across different numpy versions.
- Showcase full pipeline results for different point clouds
- Discuss that the final result of Point2CAD is not a true CAD - requires true BRep parametric representation
- What about master thesis, it's likely that the actual work will deviate from the proposed one in master thesis application
- A lot of notes regarding mathematical machinery, mesh operations and discrepancies between paper and implementation, 10-ish pages,
  maybe more?

---- Post Point2CAD ----
- CADRecode simply did not work for 2 sample point clouds. It has a context length of 256, single ABC clusters contain up to 1000 points.
- Point2Primitive seems to be the closest to a full BRep model out of all papers (along with CADRecode of course), it describes a CAD model
  in terms of sketch/extrude operations and it does not (at least for now) seem to have a limit on the number of input points.
- Current occupation: Use Point2CAD fitted surfaces and construct a real BRep model from them. Convert INR to BSpline, perform intersections
  using OpenCascade Python bindings, clip the objects to the input point cloud. If successful, a real contribution, no one has done this
  so far up to my knowledge.
- Another interesting direction: Instead of 2 steps: fit INR + fit a BSpline, somehow jointly train INR to adapt a BSpline, this
  would be another research novelty.
- What has been done so far: 
    - Cluster adjacency matrix: Compute median distance over nearest neighbor distances for all clusters, m. Declare clusters adjacent
      if 2-percentile nearest neighbor distance (configurable) falls within m * threshold (1.5, configurable)
    
    - Compute analytical intersections between adjacents clusters via OCC. In the case of simlper intersections (plane/plane, plane/sphere,
    use handwritten solutions). Result: parametric curves.

    - Trim curves to boundary points. First, if the resulting curve has a compact parameter space, we will not perform any trimming (for now
      at least). If the curve has an infinite parameter space, project boundary points (points from clusters that matched the distance threshold
      in adjacency matrix computation), and compute the minimum and maximum parameter values for projected points (using lowest distance points
      for reference if there are multiple projections for a single point). Extend this minimum and maximum thresholds by relative extension
      parameter, and generate a trimmed curve with this new parameter space.
