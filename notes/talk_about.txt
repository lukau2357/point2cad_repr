- Different runtimes across different numpy versions.
- Showcase full pipeline results for different point clouds
- Discuss that the final result of Point2CAD is not a true CAD - requires true BRep parametric representation
- What about master thesis, it's likely that the actual work will deviate from the proposed one in master thesis application
- A lot of notes regarding mathematical machinery, mesh operations and discrepancies between paper and implementation, 10-ish pages,
  maybe more?

Beyond Point2CAD:
- CadRECODE only supports up to 256 points, probably not ideal. Failed for both ABC sample point clouds, perhaps the normalization
  was not conducted correctly?

- Scan2BRep - Point-level classification, classifies points as boundary/interior and then boundary point classification as
junction/not junction. Combine somehow with current surface fitting approach/

- Mesh2BRep - Inherently does segmentation + primitive surface fitting. We already have primitive surface fitting implemented,
  bypass these 2 steps and continue onwards to get a BRep?
